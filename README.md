# THICC - Clipping and Saturation Plugin

THICC is a free, open-source clipping/saturation plugin with up to 16x oversampling, some less common soft clipping curves (like Inflator's sine wave), dry/wet mix, and high/low pass filters.

Go [here](https://lysultima.github.io/thicc/) for download and plugin manual.

Download is windows only, but you may compile it yourself by downloading [JUCE](https://juce.com/) and using Projucer to open the THICC.jucer file. 

# Changelog
